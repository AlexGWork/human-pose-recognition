Dataset link - http://human-pose.mpi-inf.mpg.de/
The directory includes:
- notebooks with experiments, proprocessing and learning NN (.ipnb files)
- window app (main_window.py)
- module with predicting method (convnet_processing.py)
- file with methods to preprocess data (experiment_settings.py)
- class to load data (MPII.py)
- CNN class (convnet.py)
- labeled learning data (filitzin.csv)
- trained model (model.pth)
Start main_window.py to see demonstration of working CNN.
